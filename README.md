# learn-design-patterns
This repo contains the notes and sample codes I generated while learning about software design patterns

# Design Patterns
1. [Strategy / Policy](notes/strategy.md)
2. [Observer](notes/observer.md)

# Design Principles
1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2. Program to an interface,  not an implementation.
3. Favor composition over inheritance.
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
